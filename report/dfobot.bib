   abstract = {The age structure of a fish population has important implications for recruitment processes and population fluctuations, and is a key input to fisheries-assessment models. The current method of determining age structure relies on manually reading age from otoliths, and the process is labor intensive and dependent on specialist expertise. Recent advances in machine learning have provided methods that have been remarkably successful in a variety of settings, with potential to automate analysis that previously required manual curation. Machine learning models have previously been successfully applied to object recognition and similar image analysis tasks. Here we investigate whether deep learning models can also be used for estimating the age of otoliths from images. We adapt a pre-trained convolutional neural network designed for object recognition, to estimate the age of fish from otolith images. The model is trained and validated on a large collection of images of Greenland halibut otoliths. We show that the model works well, and that its precision is comparable to documented precision obtained by human experts. Automating this analysis may help to improve consistency, lower cost, and increase the extent of age estimation. Given that adequate data are available, this method could also be used to estimate age of other species using images of otoliths or fish scales.},

    abstract = {Otoliths are a central information source for fish ecology and stock management, conveying important data about age and other life history for individual fish. Traditionally, interpretation of otoliths has required skilled expert readers, but recently deep learning classification and regression models have been trained to extract fish age from images of otoliths from a variety of species. Despite high accuracy in many cases, the adoption of such models in fisheries management has been slow. One reason may be that the underlying mechanisms the model uses to derive its results from the data are opaque, and this lack of legibility makes it challenging to build sufficient trust in the results. Here, we implement a deep learning model that instead of age predicts the location of annotation marks for each of the annuli. This allows an expert to evaluate the model’s performance in detail. The quality of the annotations was judged by a panel of four expert otolith readers in a double-blinded randomized survey. Using a scale from 1 to 5, the generated marks received an average quality score of 4.22, whereas expert annotations received an average score of 4.33. By counting the marks to determine fish age, we obtained an agreement between expert and model annotations of 64\% on our test set, which running the model stochastically increased to 69\%. Stochastic sampling yields further benefits, including an explicit measure of the model’s uncertainty, the post hoc likelihood of the different age classes for each otolith, and a set of alternative annotation sequences that highlight the structure of the annuli.},
